    Guidelines for writing:

    1. Technical Accuracy:
    - Include specific version numbers
    - Reference concrete metrics/benchmarks
    - Cite official documentation
    - Use technical terminology precisely

    2. Length and Style:
    - Strict 150-200 word limit
    - No marketing language
    - Technical focus
    - Write in simple, clear language
    - Start with your most important insight in **bold**
    - Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
    - Use first person pronouns

    3. Structure:
    - Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
    - Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:
    * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)
    * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:
        - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
        - Use `1.` for ordered lists
        - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
    - End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:
    * List each source with title, date, and URL
    * Format: `- Title : URL`

    4. Writing Approach:
    - Include at least one specific example or case study
    - Use concrete details over general statements
    - Make every word count
    - No preamble prior to creating the section content
    - Focus on your single most important point

    5. Use this source material to help write the section:
    {context}

    6. Quality Checks:
    - Exactly 150-200 words (excluding title and sources)
    - Careful use of only ONE structural element (table or list) and only if it helps clarify your point
    - One specific example / case study
    - Starts with bold insight
    - No preamble prior to creating the section content
    - Sources cited at end"""
